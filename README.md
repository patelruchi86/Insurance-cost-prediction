Regression analysis & statistical analysis.


Abstract: The objective of the problem is to predict the healthcare costs based on each person’s characteristics like age, gender, bmi, number of the children, their smoking habits, hospitalization charges and try to understand the pattern of each parameter by various visualization.


Overview: In the USA, the majority of the people have private health insurance, or a insurance through the current employer and minority people are covered through the government sponsored program. The insurer calculates the premiums based on the two major factor, the cost which is predict under their policies and the cost of operating policies or plans. The estimation included policyholder’s health status, age, employment status, wages, region of residency etc.
	In terms of statistical methods, regression analysis is often used to predict the healthcare cost and calculate the premiums. By performing the exploratory data analysis, will analyze the relation between various attributes and medical costs and determine is there any significant difference in medical costs between different groups. For define the relation between most affected parameter we will do the hypothesis test whether difference is significant or not? and perform the regression algorithm to predict the true cost of an insurance policy, allowing insurance company to set the competitive price to stay in healthy compition.
	Based on the observation and final insight, we will discuss the appropriate recommendations and provide the conclusion.
Language: R and other required libraries.
